## Petfinder 'Pawpularity' Predictive Analytics Project
This repository contains the work of our team on the "Petfinder 'Pawpularity' Contest," aimed at predicting the popularity of pet images. Our project leverages advanced machine learning techniques and models to analyze and predict the appeal of pet images on the Petfinder platform.

## Project Overview
### Objective: To develop a predictive model that accurately determines the 'Pawpularity' score of pet images based on various features.

## Methodology
Our approach incorporates multiple transfer learning models and advanced image processing techniques to enhance prediction accuracy. Key components include:

Data Augmentation: To enrich our training dataset and improve model robustness.
Transfer Learning Models: Utilizing pre-trained models such as EfficientNet and ResNet, adapted for our specific task.
Feature Engineering: Incorporating metadata and image features to create a comprehensive feature set for training.
Model Ensemble: Combining predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning model parameters to optimize performance.
